# Treasure-Hunting
Made a program that uses Disjoint Sets, (with union rank and path compression techniques implemented), to explore a given 2-D map, made up of chambers containing valuables. The exploration is carried out by randomly breaking the walls of the chambers. A path is is laid out to get to the bottom right chamber, beyond which the most valuable treasure is located.
